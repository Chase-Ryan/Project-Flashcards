Create a web app with the ability to create decks of cards.

A user should have the ability to create new decks or edit existing ones via a form. Each deck should contain cards.

Each card should have a front and back side that can be edited via a form to either add new cards or edit an existing one. Each card should have a flip button to display the text on the front/back of the card. If on the back of the card, a next button should be displayed to cycle to the next card in the deck. If a user clicks "Next" on the last card, a prompt should show up asking whether the user wants to restart studying the deck, or to return to the homepage to pick a new deck to study.

Decks and cards should be able to be deleted.
